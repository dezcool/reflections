When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working in collaboration or developing open source software.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To be sure of when files are up-to-date.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork clones within GitHub, whereas clones will carbon copy complete projects within/to a local computer. Branches are ramifications of the same project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Now I'm officially lost.
