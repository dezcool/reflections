What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A hidden meta-data directory call .git is created. I need it so that it tracks changes to files and directories.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area indicates which files are being monitored. It adds value as other files within the same directory may not be monitored and therefore ignored by git.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By committing after every logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Situation would be with experimental changes while keeping the original version. Branches help because changes are not applied to the original master version.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

It shows what I can expect from branches and individual commits.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

Commits from both branches are merged into the main branch (master). Idk.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

This shite is getting confusing. Auto merge is good when same files have not been modified.
